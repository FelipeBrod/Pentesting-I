## Week 16 Homework Submission File: Penetration Testing 1

#### Step 1: Google Dorking


- Using Google, can you identify who the Chief Executive Officer of Altoro Mutual is: 
    
      Karl Fitzgerald

- How can this information be helpful to an attacker:

      For social engineering purposes, an attacker might find the CEO in social media, consequently their spouses, and children, and throught threats, or with simple requests to these less aware people, throught phone calls, and phishing emails; attackers might be able to get access to their home network, deploying trojans, and other malwares since home networks are usually less protected than enterprise ones. These attacks might acquire credentials, logins and other sensitive information from the CEO.

#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: 

         Sunnyvale, CA, United States.

  2. What is the NetRange IP address:

         65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure:

         Rackspace Backbone Engineering

 4. What is the IP address of the DNS server:demo.testfire.net
        
         96.7.50.64
        

#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find:

        53 TCP/UDP

### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 
                
         nmap -T4 -F -oN zenmapscan.txt --script-vsftpd-backdoor 192.168.0.10

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  
  1. What is the vulnerability:

         presence of the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor
         
  2. Why is it dangerous:

         An attacker might get root access to the vulnerable machine.
         

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:

         A system patch.
